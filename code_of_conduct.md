Because github keeps nagging me to add one.

# Scope
### This Code of Conduct is only enforcable for the following:
1. Interactions on official project pages. (Git repos, issues, commits, etc)
2. When you are representing the project. (I.E. Stating "I am a X developer" in a discussion, only applies for that discussion)

### What this does not cover:
1. Unrelated off-site interactions.
2. Issues that happened on other projects.
3. Having "X developer" in your bio or profile.

# Guidelines
1. Remember the human.
2. Don't spam.
3. Don't go out of your way to make yourself a problem for others.
4. Don't abuse powers that you may have.
5. Don't publish information about people that they haven't published themselves.
6. The code of conduct is not a weapon, don't use it as such.
7. Do your best.

# Recommendations
1. Share knowledge, don't force it. (I.E. Recommend a specific method, don't demand people to use it)
2. Have fun.
