Because github keeps nagging me to add one.

# Scope
### This Code of Conduct is only enforcable for the following:
1. Interactions on official project pages. (Git repos, issues, commits, IRC, etc)
2. When you are representing the project. (I.E. Stating "I am a X developer" in a discussion, only applies for that discussion)

### What this does not cover:
1. Unrelated off-site interactions.
2. Issues that happened on other projects.
3. Having "X developer" in your bio or profile.

# Guidelines
1. Remember the human.
2. Don't spam.
3. Don't go out of your way to make yourself a problem for others.
4. Don't abuse powers that you may have.
5. Don't publish information about people that they haven't published themselves.
6. The code of conduct is not a weapon, don't use it as such.
7. Do your best.

# Recommendations
1. Share knowledge, don't force it. (I.E. Recommend a specific method, don't demand people to use it)
2. Have fun.

# Disagreements
We are human, as such disagreements *will* happen. If a disagreement over something begins to get heated, please consider stepping back and taking a breather. Alternatively contact or mention a moderator to de-escelate an issue before it becomes an issue that the code of conduct has to handle.

# Enforcement
In the interest of transparency, all reports(both pending and handled) and outcomes are public.
This includes:
* The original report. (Reporter name may in certain cases)
* Parties involved.
* Party or parties handling the issue.
* Considerations and discussions made by the parties handling the issue.
* All investigative information, including all parties' sides of the issue.
* Outcome of the issue, including action taken, ban duration(if applicable), and/or warnings issued.

### Transparency exception
Exception to this is in the event that the issue in scenarios where the evidence may be deleted during investigation, or if law enforcement is involved.
These reports will be publishized after the issue has been handled.

### Public comments
Public commentarys is welcome, however users are expected to remain civil when commenting on these issues.

### Elevation of action
Most issues will follow a `Warning > Final Warning > Suspension (7 day) > Suspension (30 day) > Banishment` elevation tree.
Warnings decay after 6 months. Suspensions decay after a year.

Moderators reserve the right to skip the elevation tree or issue longer ban lengths depending on the severity of the issue.

### Appealing / Contesting
Users have the right to appeal or contest an action taken against them. Appealed actions will immediately decay if approved.
Users may only appeal one issue only once unless new evidence is to be presented. Appeals must be handled by the moderator who issued the original action.
Rejected appeals can be contested for review by the project lead if the user feels the moderator is biased against them, if the rejecting moderator is the project lead, then either 2 moderators or 4 unrelated parties may be elected to handle the issue.

### Moderator agreement
* Moderators are to take enforcement seriously and to not take their power lightly. We don't want to discourage people from contributing.
* Moderators must set aside all biases, be it political or otherwise.
* Moderators are forbidden with dealing with issues that involve themselves or their friends.

# Reporting, questions/concerns/comments/suggestions, etc:
Please open a issue here: https://github.com/FelixWolf/.github/issues

Concerns about the code of conduct *will never* lead to any punishment or retaliation. If you feel that you are somehow disadvantaged or otherwise harmed by the code of conduct, please feel free to raise your concerns.
I have wrote this code of conduct to ensure that *everyone*, regardless of who they are, or how anyone may perceive them, is welcome in our community and is treated equally as human beings.
